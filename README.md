# Human Trafficking Research Project


Investigation into Human Trafficking in the UK

This report will focus on human trafficking within the UK. Analysis will be made using data that has been scrapped from

National Crime Agency. I will seek to answer key statistical questions that have been formulated in consultations with an

expert in the field.

Defining the Project Domain and Identifying Data Sources

Overview of the domain

I met with the founder of Red Light Campaign, a charity that helps human-trafficked victims. Key insights where gained about

the nature of the domain and possible sources of data. I also found out what kinds of questions would be interesting to

investigate.
